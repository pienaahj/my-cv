<p>This site was created as in VueJS (pure and with some help from MDBVue) partly an exercise in single page apps,
to serve as a personal demonstrative example of an available project on the internet and as a more reactive way to visualise and extend my resume.</p> 
<p>The app ulitizes vuex, vue-router and uses Firebase Realtime Database as a store, from where the data is loaded at runtime.</p> 
<p>The site is hosted on Firebase.</p>
<p>The data was populated on Firebase by a Golang app.</p>
